### Naming convention in smart contracts

- For contracts names and structs use PascalCase like `CredentialDefinitionRegistry`
- For methods use camelCase like `createRevocationRegistry`
- For struct fields / contract fields use snake_case like `credential_id`
- For temporary variables use snake_case prepended with _ like `_temporary_variable`
- For mappings name it in snake_case with `key_name_to_value_name` like `id_to_credential_schema`
